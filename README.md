## Beside the codes & FAQ
### Code logic
"<i>Turbo Wallet Miner</i>" is a loop code which objective (as every Wallet Miner) is to brute force crack an Ethereum wallet.
<b>How does this happen though?</b>
1. <i>Turbo</i> generates a random possible ethereum private key hex
2. <i>Turbo</i> tries to access using the generated possible private key
3. If private key is valid and <i>Turbo</i> was able to access a wallet, it goes further. Otherwise it will return to <i>Step 1</i>. That's a <b>[BAD MATCH]</b>
4. <i>Turbo</i> fetch acquired wallet ETH balance.
5. If fetched ETH balance is greater than 0,002 ETH(5$, writing time). It goes further. Otherwise it will return to to <i>Step 1</i>. That's a <b>[BAD HIT]</b>
6. Finally, if the overtaken wallet has enough ETH for transactions, <i>Turbo</i> will automatically send the recovered ETH to your main ethereum address
7. Once transactions are submitted, <i>Turbo</i> will display TxHASH and transferred balance.
8. <i>Turbo</i> will continue trying to find another wallet. Repeating from <i>Step 1</i>
